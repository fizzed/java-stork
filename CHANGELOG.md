Stork by Fizzed
=======================================

#### 3.1.1 - 2020-12-07

 - Support for custom service section to be appended for SystemD configs

#### 3.1.0 - 2020-06-09

 - Bump blaze to v1.0.0
 - Bump crux to v1.0.23

#### 3.0.1 - 2020-06-01

 - Support for new "maxJavaVersion" config property to limit JVMs in a range
   of versions.
 - Bump blaze to v0.21.0

#### 3.0.0 - 2019-07-29

 - Add support for Java 11+ (@ajcamilo)

#### 2.7.0 - 2017-11-05

 - stork-launcher: Java 9 support for launchers (java version can now be set
   to 9.0 or 1.8 or 1.7, etc.)
 - stork-launcher: JAVA_EXE environment variable can be used to tell launcher
   exactly what JVM to use for starting app (e.g. JAVA_EXE=/usr/bin/java myapp)
 - stork-launcher: Improved support for paths with spaces
 - stork-launcher: Linux scripts now detect if they are running on Windows
   (e.g. in Cygwin) and will search well-known paths for JVMs
 - stork-launcher: Optimized search for JVM on Windows when looked up via registry
 - stork-maven-plugin: Artifact classifiers now used (if present) when assembling
   the stork "lib" dir.

#### 2.6.1 - 2017-09-12

 - Fixed `stork-launcher` dependency issue in Maven Central.

#### 2.6.0 - 2017-09-11

 - stork-deploy: New `retain` option to only retain a specified number of past
   versions after a successful deploy.
 - stork-launcher: New `include_java_xrs` configuration option to instruct
   launcher to prepend the `-Xrs` flag for Java.  This is `true` by default.
   The `-Xrs` flag is critical to avoid Java exiting with a non-zero error code
   if you `kill` the process to stop it.  This allows inits like SYSTEMD to
   report the service stopped correctly.
 - stork-launcher: New `--exec` option for Linux daemon launchers. Combines features
   from the `--start` and `--run` actions.  This action will start your Java app
   using `exec`.  Your `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` streams will be passed though
   as-is to your app.
 - stork-launcher: SYSTEMD init scripts now use the `--exec` action to start
   your app and use the `--stop` action to gracefully stop it.  Please note
   that `stdout` will not be redirected to a file (like it was in previous
   versions) -- so you should be mindful that SYSTEMD will now log anything
   to `stdout` to `journald`.
 - stork-launcher: Windows launchers now match Linux by setting system properties
   of `launcher.name`, `launcher.type`, and `launcher.app.dir`.
 - stork-launcher: Linux daemon launcher correctly sets `launcher.type` to
   CONSOLE if `--run` is used.  You can now safely check if the `launcher.type`
   property is `DAEMON` to determine if you are really running as a service (e.g.
   you were started with SYSV or SYSTEMD).
 - Deprecated and removed stork-bootstrap. The EXTRA_JAVA_ARGS feature from v2.5.0
   mostly addresses what it was trying to accomplish.
 - Significant enhancements to all unit tests across the board.  See `docs/DEV.md`
   for info about contributing changes to the project.
 - Bumped Blaze dependency from v0.13.0 to v0.16.0

#### 2.5.1 - 2017-09-06

 - stork-launcher: Fix systemd issue with java classpath in quotes
 - stork-deploy: Verification of startup simply waits 5-6 seconds by default
   rather than searching for text of OK

#### 2.5.0 - 2017-09-05

 - stork-launcher: Command-line arguments starting with "-D" are now detected and passed to
   your application as Java System Properties rather than as application arguments. (@jjlauer)
 - stork-launcher: Daemons across all platforms now passthrough application arguments or
   System properties for the "--run" command. (@jjlauer)
 - stork-launcher: New "EXTRA_APP_ARGS" and "EXTRA_JAVA_ARGS" configuration/variables
   so that you can define standard ones for your app, but allow users to pass in
   extra variables vs. only being able to override what you provided. (@jjlauer)
 - stork-launcher: Cygwin compatability on Windows (e.g. running in Bash, Git Bash, or
   Docker terminal). The linux scripts all work on Windows when running in a cygwin
   environment. (@jjlauer)
 - stork-launcher: Detect APP_HOME first before initializing other variables. Allows using it
   to help build other properties. (@BertrandA)
 - stork-deploy: Added `/etc/init.d/crond` while trying to detect for SYSV init (@erbrecht)
 - Dependencies all updated to latest versions.
 - Improved unit testing for Windows (see Vagrantfile windows10 VM)

#### 2.4.0 - 2016-12-09

 - Add new `unattended` option to cli and deploy options to prevent prompts during deploy

#### 2.3.0 - 2016-09-07

 - `stork-deploy` has all blaze-* dependencies in `provided` scope to help
   avoid version conflicts when directly used in [Blaze](https://github.com/fizzed/blaze)

#### 2.2.1 - 2016-08-31

 - Fixed issue with systemd services not starting at boot. Removed `alias` from
   default systemd template

#### 2.2.0 - 2016-08-29

 - Support for `systemd`! `stork-launcher` will generate `share/systemd` service
   files and `stork-deploy` will intelligently deploy it.
 - Support for deploying thru SSH proxy/bastion/jump hosts.  If your `.ssh/config`
   file uses any common `ProxyCommand` options then stork will likely work out-of-the-box.
   Please see [blaze ssh docs](https://github.com/fizzed/blaze/blob/master/docs/SSH.md)
   for more info.
 - Launchers for windows now preserve environment variables allowing users to
   override properties on an execution.
 - Fixed bug where temp deploy files were not always deleted (especially on windows)
 - Added Ubuntu 16.04 as reference system to verify launchers & deployments.
 - Dependencies updated:
    - blaze v0.11.1 to v0.12.0
    - jackson v2.7.3 to v2.8.1
    - slf4j v1.7.20 to v1.7.21
    - commons-compress v1.9 to v1.12
    - crux-vagrant v0.3.2 to v0.4.0

#### 2.1.1 - 2016-06-24

 - Fix for environment variables (such as JAVA_ARGS) that contained spaces
   causing a launcher script to partially fail. 

#### 2.1.0 - 2016-06-23

 - Deploys are assigned a UUID
 - Fixed issue w/ multiple users deploying to same target being unable to 
   delete each others temp work dir.  The work dir now has the deploy UUID
   appended so each user + deploy gets their own unique deploy work dir.

#### 2.0.1 - 2016-05-19

 - Allow specifying APP_ARGS and JAVA_ARGS in /etc/default/myapp (gitblit)

#### 2.0.0 - 2016-04-13

 - Major refactor and much more polished project layout
 - Requires Java 1.7+
 - All project artifacts now starts with "stork-" rather than "fizzed-stork-"
 - stork-sbt-play-plugin deprecated (Fizzed has moved away from scala w/
   Java8 and we didn't have time to update this dependency, PRs welcome)
 - Vagrant used to unit test and verify launchers work across numerous 
   operating system distributions.
 - Launchers certified on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu 14.04, CentOS 7, Debian 8,
   FreeBSD 10.2, and OpenBSD 5.8.  You can also easily verify another platform
   by suppling a vagrant instance and running "mvn test -Dhost=name" with the target
 - Command-line stork-generate renamed to stork-launcher with more polished
   interface and arguments.
 - stork-fabric-deploy deprecated and replaced with Java-based stork-deploy
 - stork-deploy is embeddable within other Java apps
 - stork-deploy supports everything stork-fabric-deploy did, but with numerous
   new features.
    - Secure deployments by using strict permissions
    - Deploy config files supported (in simple java properties format)
    - Configurable prefix directory, user, and group
    - Initial systemd support

   was not found

   dir name
